        <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>
            When I was in college, I used to be in a band. I love to create and play music. This is how I used to express myself.<br>
            I've always dreamed of making music for a living. Listening to bands excites me but I am not just a fan. I always have that urge in me to create my own music.
            </p>
            <p> That's why growing up, I learned the following musical instruments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guitar</li>
                    <li>Bass Guitar</li>
                    <li>Drums</li>
                    <li>Keyboards</li>
                </ul>  
        <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>
            Today, I am dad. I still play music but only on my free time which is rare. My love for it is still there but it's hard to go back to it when life is happening.<br>
            Taking care of 3 kids can really eat up your time. Though it helps when they are in school. But even if they are, I spend my day looking for a job as I am currently<br>
            not working right now. I am learning to code to add more<br>
            skills that I can use in the future.
            </p>
            <p>Today, I am currently in the Marketing, Advertising, and Design industry and my expertise are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creative Direction</li>
                    <li>Art Direction</li>
                    <li>Graphic Design</li>
                    <li>Video Production</li>
                    <li>Concept Development</li>
                    <li>Presentation Design</li>
                </ol>
            <p>All these are being showcased on my <a href=https://www.jipangan.com>website</a> </p> 
        <h2>Future</h2>
            <p> My goal is to put together all the things that I love and fully express myself to a product that I can share. <br>
            I would love to develop an app where I can express my love for music and creativity. I hope to develop something that will build a community because <br>
            it's something that's useful to them.</p>
            <p>Another thing that I want to create that's useful to my craft is a design tool that will automatically convert a slide design to a <br> 
            mobile layout format. I believe this is something that design companies are overlooking right now. People use their mobile device more than their computers. 
            Any information out there should be ready to be seen in any kind of screen. <br> Below is an example of the type of design that I want to create and develop.</p>
